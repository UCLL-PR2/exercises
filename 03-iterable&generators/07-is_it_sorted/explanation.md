# Assignment

create a function called **is_it_sorted()** that takes in a list as an argument. The function should iterate through the list and check if each element is greater than or equal to the previous element. If it is, the function should continue iterating. If an element is found to be less than the previous element, the function should return the index at which this occurs. If the entire list is iterated and no such element is found, the function should return the string "sorted!". For this exercise you the **enumeration** function.  

```python

my_list = [0, 1, -10, 2]


def is_it_sorted(my_list):
    pass #write your code here

```
