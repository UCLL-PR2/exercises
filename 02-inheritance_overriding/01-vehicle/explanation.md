# Vehicle Exercise

Create a class called Vehicle that has the following attributes and methods:

- `brand`: a string representing the brand of the vehicle
- `model`: a string representing the model of the vehicle
- `year`: an integer representing the year the vehicle was made
- `speed`: an integer representing the current speed of the vehicle, which starts at 0 value.

The `Vehicle` class should also have the following methods:

- `accelerate`: increases the speed of the vehicle by 10
- `brake`: decreases the speed of the vehicle by 7
- `honk`: returns the string *"HONK!"*

Then (continue to work in the student.py file), **create two subclasses of Vehicle called `Car` and `Truck`**. The `Car` class should have an additional attribute called `num_doors`, and the `Truck` class should have an additional attribute called `bed_size`.

Both the `Car` and `Truck` classes should have their own implementation of the `honk` method that returns a different string. In the `Car` class this method should return `"Beep beep!"` and in the `Truck` class `"Honk honk!"`.

Next, **create a class called `Garage`** that has a single attribute `vehicles`, which is a list of `Vehicle` objects. The `Garage` class should have a method called `add_vehicle` which takes a `Vehicle` object as an argument and adds it to the vehicles list. If the argument is not of type `Vehicle` then raise a **TypeError("The object is not of type 'Vehicle'")**.

TODO Where is it explained how to check an object's type?
