# Assignment

Write a function `between(x, lower, upper)` that checks if `x` is larger than or equal to `lower` and less than or equal to `upper`.
Using Python, it is possible to write this down as a single expression, but know that Python is actually an exception: typically you not a conjunction (`&&`) of two comparisons.
