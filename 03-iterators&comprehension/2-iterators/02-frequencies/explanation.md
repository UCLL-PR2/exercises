Java calls them `Map`s, JavaScript calls them objects.
Python has chosen to call them *dictionaries*.

Dictionaries are containers that allow you to
store associations between values, commonly called the key and value.
A typical example would be an actual
dictionary, where each word (key)
is associated with its description (value).
Dictionaries are data structures optimized for
quickly looking up the value associated with a given
key. While the opposite direction (given a value finding the associated key) is *possible*,
it is very slow and not built-in.

A dictionary has the typical operations defined
on them. Skim over the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries):
it's generally very helpful to have a general
idea of what functions are available to you, so
that when you're working with dictionaries and you
need some specific functionality, you might remember it
already exists.

Write a function `frequencies(xs)` that counts the frequency
of each item in the array `xs` and returns the result as a dictionary.
For example,

```python
>>> xs = [ 'a', 'b', 'b', 'c', 'c', 'c' ]

>>> frequencies(xs)
{ 'a': 1, 'b': 2, 'c': 3 }
```

```javascript
function frequencies(xs)
{
    // Look up how to represent the empty dictionary in Python
    const result = {};

    for ( const x of xs )
    {
        // Look up how to check if x occurs as key in the dictionary
        if ( !(x in result) )
        {
            // Look up how to add new key/value pair
            result[x] = 0;
        }

        // Look up how to update value
        result[x]++;
    }

    return result;
}
```
