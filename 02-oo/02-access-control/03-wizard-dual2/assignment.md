# WIZARD DUEL
Let's give our wizards the ability to launch fireballs at each other.

## ASSIGNMENT
Complete the `cast_fireball` method.

Casting a fireball costs `20` mana
If the wizard doesn't have enough mana, raise the exception `{1} cannot cast fireball`, where `{1}` is the caster's name.
Otherwise, make sure the target is "fireballed", then return `{1} casts fireball a {2}`, where `{1}` is the caster's name and `{2}` is the target's name.
